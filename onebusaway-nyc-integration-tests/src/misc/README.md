summarize-csvs.rb
=================

Scans the list of files in src/integration-test/resources/traces
(assumed to all be CSVs) and produces a summary of columns present by file.
By default the output is comma-delimited and intended to be imported into a
spreadsheet tool.  See source file for other options.
